# Overall

- Number of affected VW cars in US estimated by the EPA is [482000](http://yosemite.epa.gov/opa/admpress.nsf/6424ac1caa800aab85257359003f5337/dfc8e33b5ab162b985257ec40057813b!OpenDocument/)
- Number of affected VW cars in California estimated by the California Air Resources Board is [50000](http://www.arb.ca.gov/newsrel/in_use_compliance_letter.htm/)
- Average number of miles driven per year estimated by the US Department of Energy to be [11244](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/data/10309/) 
- EPA Tier 2 Bin 5 standard [0.07 grams / mile](http://www3.epa.gov/otaq/standards/light-duty/tier2stds.htm/)
- ICCT estimated VW cars had NOx emissions [15-35 times](http://www.theicct.org/news/epas-notice-violation-clean-air-act-volkswagen-press-statement) the legal limit (0.07)

## Estimate 1: Margot Sanger-Katz and John Schwartz

```{r}
# total tons in US since late 2008
tons <- 46000

350 / (46000 / 6)
46000 / (.38 * 1000 * 2539)

# unclear, from  DechÃªnes working paper
redmort <- .04

deaths <- 106
```

## Estimate 2: Noelle Eckley Selin

```{r}
# total tons in US since late 2008
tons <- 46000

# Deaths per ton of NOx from EPA/ Krewski et al. 2009
deathsperton <- 0.00085

deaths <- deathsperton * tons

# Total deaths over 6 years in US
round(deaths, 2)
